# Support Vector Machines(SVM)

Support Vector Machines (SVMs in short) are machine learning algorithms that are used for classification and regression purposes. SVMs are one of the powerful machine learning algorithms for classification, regression and outlier detection purposes. An SVM classifier builds a model that assigns new data points to one of the given categories. Thus, it can be viewed as a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.

# About the dataset

Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter. Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted,which treat the candidate data sets as binary classification problems.

# Expected output

Missing values should be treated

Perform Standerdisation and handle outliers

perform Support Vector Mchines and tune the model to increase the efficiency of the model
